# InternalWaveStability
Numerical implementation of stability analysis for internal gravity wave beams.  The formulation of these analyses are outlined in [Karimi and Akylas (2014)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2014.509) and [my PhD thesis](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/100060). Primarily coded in Matlab.
